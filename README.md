   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-randomizer-tutor.git
   ```  
2. Compile the code using a C compiler, such as GCC:  
   ```bash
   gcc -o math_tutor math_tutor.c
   ```  
3. Run the compiled program:  
   ```bash
   ./math_tutor
   ```  

### Option 2: Running in Visual Studio Code  
1. Open the `.c` file in Visual Studio Code.  
2. Install the **Code Runner** extension or ensure you have **g++** installed on your system.  
3. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and navigate to the file's directory.  
4. Compile the program using the following command:
