## ⚙️ **Installation** ⚙️  

### Option 1: Using GCC in the Terminal  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-randomizer-tutor.git
   ```  
2. Compile the code using a C compiler, such as GCC:  
   ```bash
   gcc -o math_tutor math_tutor.c
   ```  
3. Run the compiled program:  
   ```bash
   ./math_tutor
   ```  

### Option 2: Running in Visual Studio Code  
1. Open the `.c` file in Visual Studio Code.  
2. Install the **Code Runner** extension or ensure you have **g++** installed on your system.  
3. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and navigate to the file's directory.  
4. Compile the program using the following command:  
   ```bash
   g++ file_name.c
   ```  
5. Run the compiled program:  
   ```bash
   ./a.exe
   ```

## 📋 **Usage**  
- Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions.  
- Use the menu to select a math operation:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division  
- Enter your choices for the number of questions and the maximum value of numbers.  
- Answer the questions as they appear.  
- Check your performance and replay if desired!  

## 🖥️ **Code Overview**  
The program is divided into several functions for modularity and readability:

- **Math Operations**: Functions like `addNum`, `subtractNum`, `multiplyNum`, and `divideNum` handle the arithmetic operations.  
- **User Input**: Functions like `maxQuestions` and `maxValue` let the user specify preferences.  
- **Randomization**: The randomizing function generates random numbers within a specified range.  
- **Loading Animations**: `intro_loading` and `exit_loading` add a visual appeal.  
- **Scoring System**: Tracks and displays scores across multiple sessions.
